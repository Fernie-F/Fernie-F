Interested in blockchain applications.
I'm learning about Distributed Systems.

I'm looking to scale the Stacks network by the creation of subnets. Right now, I'm working on a utilities library for Bitcoin and then for Stacks.

Most of my commits are on Gitlab, I just port them over to Github: https://gitlab.com/Fernie
